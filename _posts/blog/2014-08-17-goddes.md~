...and the flowers  
they keep trying to be as royal as you are  
Darling, I can sense your presence in the verdant hill  
The wind brings me your scent  
instead of bringing you  
it never did  
You're unbelievable, yet imaginable  
Deity of imagination, a corrosive truth lies beneath this feeble sanity  
A heavy heart - it wont get softer  
Itâ€™s tearing me apart - when did I started to hold onto a thread looking so miserable?
