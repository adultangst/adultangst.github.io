As we exchanged poison mouth to mouth
I'll keep on healing all my fears
brooding all the things you said to me
just waiting for the chance to spit it on your throat
Dont die on me already, my sweet melancholy
Didn't I told you, these colours dont run
but a moment of clarity, just as your pleasant epiphany
Oh, sweet morbid poetry, please dont let...
Use my muse, use everything you got on me
Use it as a shield or a victim of my own ways
As I recognise that it is a childish play
Your bullet opens a wound that will not scar
and let my eyes turns grey
