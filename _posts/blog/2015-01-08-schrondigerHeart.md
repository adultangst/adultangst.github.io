Your biggest fear is to forget that time's running out  
and you're barely able to breathe  
It's an asphyxiant despair, isn't?  
Wasting time, youth, health and smiles on something so vague and not profound  
Profound enough to leave a mark on your heart  
Maybe a heartache   
Just leave a mark in your heart  
That's what it needs  
Just leave a fucking mark in your schrodinger heart   
A genius once said:  
__"A heart that hurts it's a heart that works"__  
...and I, definitely wouldn't put it in better words
